# 👋 Hi there! I'm Buse

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a PhD student at Imperial College London, with a focus on Large Language Models. My research aims to improve LLMs by identifying their limitations and enhancing their understanding capabilities.

## 🔍 Research Interests

1. **Scientific Language Models**
   - Developing models tailored for scientific literature and discourse.
   - Enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs in understanding and generating scientific content.

2. **Factually Correct Debiased Generations**
   - Ensuring LLMs generate factually accurate and unbiased outputs.
   - Researching methodologies to mitigate biases and enhance fairness in model predictions.

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Experience

- **Applied Scientist Intern @ Amazon [October 2024 - Ongoing]**
   - Working on innovating machine translation methods.

- **AI Research Intern @ IBM Research [Summer 2024]**
  - Explored the knowledge and language quality gaps in debiased language models. Investigated faithful and fair language generation methods.
   
- **AI Research Intern @ IBM Research [Summer 2023]**
  - Developed a computational feedback based fine-tuning method for harnessing generative capabilities of large language models on sensitive downstream tasks where human evaluations are ambigious and expensive to obtain. 
  
- **Machine Learning Engineer II @ Comcast NBCUniversal**
  - Implemented machine learning solutions to improve the forecasting models for click-rate, video-completion rate and as such metrics.


## 🚀 Current Projects

- **End-to-End Large Models Training**
  - Investigating the secrets of efficient training processes for large models.
  - Sharing insights and methodologies to contribute to public knowledge in this domain. [An outdated but quite detailed chronicle for 175B model training](https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/tree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles)
  - Favourites repos so far: [GPT with C/CUDA](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c.git) , [Llama3 from scratch](https://github.com/naklecha/llama3-from-scratch)
