# 👋 Hi there! I'm Buse

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a PhD student at Imperial College London, with a focus on Large Language Models. My research aims to improve LLMs by identifying their limitations and enhancing their understanding capabilities.

## 🔍 Research Interests

1. **Scientific Language Models**
   - Developing models tailored for scientific literature and discourse.
   - Enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs in understanding and generating scientific content.

2. **Factually Correct Fair Representations**
   - Ensuring LLMs generate factually accurate and unbiased outputs.
   - Researching methodologies to mitigate biases and enhance fairness in model predictions.

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Experience

- **AI Research Intern @ IBM Research**
  - Developed a computational feedback based fine-tuning method for harnessing generative capabilities of large language models on sensitive downstream tasks where human evaluations are ambigious and expensive to obtain. 
  
- **Machine Learning Engineer II @ Comcast NBCUniversal**
  - Implemented machine learning solutions to improve the forecasting models for click-rate, video-completion rate and as such metrics.


## 🚀 Current Projects

- **End-to-End Large Models Training**
  - Investigating the secrets of efficient training processes for large models.
  - Sharing insights and methodologies to contribute to public knowledge in this domain.
  - Favourites repos so far: ![GPT with C/CUDA](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c.git) , ![Llama3 from scratch](https://github.com/naklecha/llama3-from-scratch)
